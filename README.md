# Welcome to Go Programming!

This README is designed to introduce you to Go (often referred to as Golang), a statically typed, compiled programming language known for its simplicity and efficiency. Whether you're new to programming or coming from another language, this guide will help you get started with the basics of Go, including concurrency and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Go:** Download and install Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
2. **Set Up Your Workspace:** Create a workspace directory where you will keep your Go projects. Set the `GOPATH` environment variable to this directory.
3. **Write Your First Program:** Create a file named `main.go` in your workspace with the following content:

    ```go
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
    }
    ```

4. **Run Your Program:** Open your terminal, navigate to your workspace directory, and execute the command `go run main.go`. You should see the output: `Hello, Go!`.

## Basic Syntax

- **Packages:** Every Go program is organized into packages. The `main` package is special; it defines the entry point of the program.
- **Imports:** Use the `import` statement to include external packages.
- **Functions:** The `func` keyword is used to define functions. The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
- **Comments:** Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments.

## Variables and Types

- **Variable Declaration:** Use the `var` keyword or the shorthand `:=` for declaring variables.

    ```go
    var x int = 10
    y := 20
    ```

- **Basic Types:** Go has several basic types including `int`, `float64`, `bool`, and `string`.

    ```go
    var name string = "Alice"
    var age int = 25
    var height float64 = 5.7
    var isStudent bool = true
    ```

## Control Structures

- **Conditionals:**

    ```go
    if age > 18 {
        fmt.Println("Adult")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Minor")
    }
    ```

- **Loops:** Use `for` for looping.

    ```go
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
    ```

## Functions

- **Defining Functions:** Functions in Go can return multiple values.

    ```go
    func add(a int, b int) (int, error) {
        return a + b, nil
    }
    ```

- **Calling Functions:**

    ```go
    sum, err := add(3, 4)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Sum:", sum)
    }
    ```

## Concurrency and Parallelism

Concurrency is dealing with multiple things at a single time, while parallelism is doing multiple things at a single time. - Rob Pike

Go’s concurrency model supports parallelism through Goroutines and Channels, allowing you to run multiple tasks simultaneously and efficiently use multiple CPU cores.

### Goroutines

A Goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. Goroutines are used to perform concurrent operations, and they are created with the `go` keyword.

### Channels

Channels are used to communicate between Goroutines. They help synchronize and pass data between Goroutines.

### Example: Concurrent Processing with Parallelism

In this example, we’ll demonstrate how to perform parallel computations using Goroutines and Channels. We’ll create a program that calculates the sum of squares of numbers in parallel.

1. **Concurrent Sum of Squares**

    ```go
    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "math/rand"
        "sync"
        "time"
    )

    func sumOfSquares(numbers []int, wg *sync.WaitGroup, ch chan<- int) {
        defer wg.Done()
        sum := 0
        for _, number := range numbers {
            sum += number * number
            // Simulate some processing time
            time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * time.Duration(rand.Intn(100)))
        }
        ch <- sum
    }

    func main() {
        rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
        
        numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
        chunkSize := len(numbers) / 4 // Number of chunks
        var wg sync.WaitGroup
        ch := make(chan int, 4) // Buffered channel to avoid blocking

        for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
            start := i * chunkSize
            end := start + chunkSize
            if i == 3 {
                end = len(numbers) // Handle last chunk
            }
            wg.Add(1)
            go sumOfSquares(numbers[start:end], &wg, ch)
        }

        // Close channel when all Goroutines are done
        go func() {
            wg.Wait()
            close(ch)
        }()

        totalSum := 0
        for sum := range ch {
            totalSum += sum
        }

        fmt.Printf("Total Sum of Squares: %d\n", totalSum)
    }
    ```

### Explanation

1. **Goroutines:** We divide the `numbers` slice into chunks and process each chunk in a separate Goroutine. Each Goroutine calculates the sum of squares for its chunk and sends the result through a channel.

2. **WaitGroup:** We use `sync.WaitGroup` to wait for all Goroutines to finish their work. We call `wg.Add(1)` before starting each Goroutine and `wg.Done()` inside the Goroutine to signal completion.

3. **Channel:** The channel `ch` is used to collect results from Goroutines. We close the channel after all Goroutines have finished processing.

4. **Parallel Processing:** The Go runtime schedules Goroutines across available CPU cores, enabling parallel execution of tasks. In this example, the Goroutines run concurrently and may execute in parallel if the system has multiple cores.

By using Goroutines and Channels, Go allows you to handle multiple tasks efficiently and take advantage of modern multi-core processors for parallel execution.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Go

Go does not have traditional classes and inheritance but provides other ways to achieve similar functionality.

- **Structs:** Use structs to create custom data types.

    ```go
    type Person struct {
        Name string
        Age  int
    }
    ```

- **Methods:** Attach methods to structs to achieve object-oriented behavior.

    ```go
    func (p Person) Greet() string {
        return "Hello, " + p.Name
    }
    ```

- **Interfaces:** Interfaces allow you to specify methods that a type must implement.

    ```go
    type Greeter interface {
        Greet() string
    }
    ```

    ```go
    func sayHello(g Greeter) {
        fmt.Println(g.Greet())
    }
    ```
